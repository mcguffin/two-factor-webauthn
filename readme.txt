(See above as well.)

Use the GitHub Repo rather than the WordPress Plugin. Do as follows:

1. If you haven't done so: [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

2. in the console cd into Your 'wp-content/plugins' directory

3. type `git clone git@github.com:/.git`

4. If you want to update to the latest files (be careful, might be untested with your WP-Version) type `git pull`.

= I found a bug and fixed it. How can I let You know? =

Either post it on the [GitHub-repo](https://github.com//) or—if you cloned the repository—send me a pull request.
